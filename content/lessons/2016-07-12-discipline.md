#### Memory verse:
> For the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.
<cite>Proverbs 3:12 - ESV (See also Hebrews 12:6)</cite>

**This lesson’s principle**: Discipline is an ongoing relationship with a mentor and student, or parent and child in which instruction, reminders, encouragement, consequences and chastisement all play a role in order to change behavior.



How much of our child-raising is based on cultural rather than biblical truths?  Biblical discipline refers to heart training, not just spanking or time outs.  It seeks to drive the “folly” out of a child.  

> A youngster's heart is filled with foolishness, but discipline will drive it away.
<cite>Pr 22:15 - NLT</cite>

Discipline comes from the same root as disciple, and it is a process of training & teaching that fosters moral development.  The positive aspects of discipline are emphasis of inner growth, personal responsibility, and self-control.

> Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.
<cite>Pr 4:23 - NKJV</cite>

Parents who biblically discipline tend to need to use punishment far less than those who don’t because they are shaping a child’s heart, not just changing behavior.  The Bible does not frequently give specific disciplinary techniques to be used in child-raising.  Instead, it gives principles on which to base these techniques.  We must always weigh our techniques against scripture to see if they, indeed, hold up to biblical standards and principles.

### Instruction
Before we can expect our children to know what is expected of them, what is right and wrong, they must receive instruction.  Most of what they learn is from watching you, but you must also verbally teach.

> The purpose of these proverbs is to teach people wisdom and discipline, and to help them understand wise sayings. Through these proverbs, people will receive instruction in discipline, good conduct, and doing what is right, just, and fair. These proverbs will make the simpleminded clever. They will give knowledge and purpose to young people.
<cite>Pr 1:2-4</cite>

> Let those who are wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser. And let those who understand receive guidance by exploring the depth of meaning in these proverbs, parables, wise sayings, and riddles.
> Fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge. Only fools despise wisdom and discipline.
<cite>Pr 1:5-7 - NLT</cite>

> Discipline your son, and he will give you peace; he will bring delight to your soul.
<cite>Pr 29:17 - NIV</cite>

> Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.
<cite>Pr 22:6 - NKJV</cite>

Instruction, training, and correction (here, meaning to educate) are necessary to teach your child what is right and wrong, to help him see the path which he should take.

> Discipline your children while there is hope. If you don't, you will ruin their lives.
<cite>Pr 19:18 - NLT</cite>

This is translated as “destruction” in many translations, but it does not refer to physical destruction but spiritual.  Of course, if we as parents are not living what we preach, our instruction is usually worthless since the child sees we do not practice what we preach.

Many, probably most, decisions and activities of life have no morality attached to them—they are simply things we do.  These behaviors are to be treated differently than those requiring moral decisions.  At the same time, we are to encourage our children in amoral areas, too.

All of us have skills (things we have learned to do), talents (natural God-given abilities), and gifts (a magnified or potentially spiritual talent).  We are to assist our children in acquiring and improving these aspects of their lives also.  Skill acquisition requires patience, guidance, and motivation.   Methods of motivation can be divided into verbal praise and goal incentives.  Verbal praise lets your child know that you love them and are pleased by their behavior.  It encourages the child regarding their progress in the disciplinary process.  Goal incentives are tangible rewards given to encourage effort and progress in skills development.  Be sure that incentives are appropriate for age and the task at hand.  Do not use a goal set too high or the child may be discouraged.

Admonishment: Warning a child that an action or lack of action is unwise and may bring a bad result. (e.g., leaving tools outside). You shouldn't necessarily punish a child for a mild infraction if he is normally characterized by immediate compliance and when admonishment will suffice. Don't get carried away, as children become exasperated when parents demand perfection and not just excellence.
> A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
<cite>Pr 25:11 - NIV</cite>

Discipline has 2 aspects: **Encouragement** and **Correction**.  Encouragement teaches, trains, and rewards right behaviors. Correction is warranted when wrong behaviors have occurred in order to cause repentance.

## Encouragement
Many, probably most, decisions and activities of life have no morality attached to them--they are simply things we do. These behaviors are to be treated differently than those requiring moral decisions. At the same time, we are to encourage our children in amoral areas, too.

*Pre-activity encouragement* comes verbally before a required behavior is expected. This reminds and prepares the child in advance so that they remember what behaviors are expected of them.

Verbal reminders: “Remember, when you meet so-and-so today, shake their hand and say, ‘Hello, Ms. ____’”

**Dialogue questions**: role play the situation which is about to happen, e.g., “Who can tell me the rules for when we go in the store?” (This is especially good for young children to take ownership of actions)
Positive words: Attempt to speak as often as possible in positive words. Instead of saying, “Don’t spill your cereal on your way to the table,” consider saying, “See how carefully you can carry your cereal to the table.” Instead of saying, “Don’t get out of bed,” consider, “Obey mommy and stay in bed.”

*Post-activity encouragement* comes after the fact.

**Affirmation**: Verbally encourage your kids in the little things and the big. Consider saying, “I need (your help)” instead of “I want” or “do this.” Say “great job,” or “great game” with your hand on their shoulder.  Hugs are always welcome.  (Helpful hint for kids AND spouses!)  Be careful not to qualify your encouragement: “Thanks for doing the dishes tonight, even though you did a poor job.”  

Affirming words from moms and dads are like light switches. Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child's life, and it's like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities.   Gary Smalley

**Rewards**: tangible or intangible (gum vs. trip to park). These are used to reinforce behavior after the fact, not to stimulate it. “Because you were so good in the store today, Mom wants to buy you a special treat.” Offering something in exchange for good behavior prior to the action is bribing. That manipulates a child’s lust of the flesh and eyes. (I Jn. 2:16a) Don’t overuse rewards, or a child becomes conditioned and dependent on receiving them; make them occasional and special.

## Correction
There are 2 goals in the correction process: helping the child take ownership of their actions/decisions, and helping them learn to make wise ones.  Allowing them to suffer the consequences of their actions will most quickly teach them to change behaviors to bring about something more pleasant.  If they are not allowed to suffer from bad decisions, they will continue to act in the same fashion, and these actions will become habitual and difficult to remove.  (I see this in the emergency room every day.)
Some rebellious or defiant behaviors will bring about natural consequences which will deter further similar actions, e.g., touching a hot stove after being warned.  Others may not have consequences, so a parent must step in and be sure that actions have consequences that will cause the child to regret their bad decision.
A healthy parent-child relationship is a necessary first priority, and correction is only one part of the discipline process. As we have learned, proper view of authority is vital; submission to scripture, essential. Outside of rightful administration, correction may actually be aggression or revenge.

**Natural Consequences:** Sometimes consequences of foolish behavior are painful in nature, elgl, slipping and falling when told not to run around the pool. This usually teaches the offender WHY he should have obeyed in the first place, and further punishment is not normally necessary. This is normally NOT the method of choice as it can be dangerous. Whenever possible, it is wiser to head it off in the first place before injury occurs.

**Structured Consequences:** When foolish behavior does not cause pain in itself, it then needs to be created artificially through structured consequences. This needs to be clear and consistent; children have contempt for weak authority and soon mock that authority. The child needs to know that punishment is exact and certain in order to learn to control his behavior.
There are three main types of structured consequences:
1. Logical consequences: Parents must always choose a method of punishment which "fits the crime"; it should be logical. If the purpose is to teach self-control according to moral principle, it will be better understood and remembered if it makes logical sense. This more often is for older children and involves taking away of privileges, "toys", cell phones/computer time, or events; or it may be extra work duties or restoration of some type. This is very broad in nature and will vary with each circumstance. It takes into account the situation as well as age and motivation of the child. It is not used often in small children as they will not learn from principles involved--they better understand physical pain.
Consequences should be related to the mistake as often as possible. Their purpose is to encourage good stewardship and to cause the child to accept responsibility for their actions. Explanations should always accompany training. Explanations should get briefer as children grow up. Denying privileges for not obeying completely is acceptable.
2. Isolation: This is the temporary removal of social contact, sometimes called "time out". We are social beings, and children love to be with others most of the time. This time-out is used as punishment for poor behavior. Reflective time-out, studied earlier, is removal of contact before a bad outcome occurs. Time-out may be used with other punishments, but care must be taken to not rely on it solely or too often. We used it mostly for lesser offenses, more childish as opposed to rebellious behaviors. It is to teach the child self-control. It also must be painful; if the child does not care or has fun when in time out, it is not effective and mocks discipline itself. Isolation is frequently not adequate to remove gui9lt which we cover below.
3. Chastisement: This is the biblical term for applying physical pain as a means of amending behavior; in our society this is typically spanking. Spanking is using controlled force to cause physical pain and ammend an inner attitude. While it should always be associated with rebellion, rebellion is not always punished with spanking. When a child knows that he broke the rules, he will feel guilt; guilt is the reminder of sin. This guilt can often be dealt with and relieved best by chastisement/spanking--truly! Chastisement is the price paid for the rebellion to remove the guilt, and this frees the child from continuous guilt. Children who carry guilt endlessly may become callused to rebellion and more easily fall into repetitive disobedience and sin. If a child is freed from his guilt caused by his disobedience, he can then be restored into a right relationship with his parents, and life can then move forward again. (This is what God does with us.) I can vividly remember all of our children being hurt by their guilt and punishment, and then made whole again when the disciplinary process is done properly. As we are restored to a right relationship with God by our repentance, so our children can be restored unto us by properly administered chastisement. There is plenty of biblical support for this.

> You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.
<cite>Dt 8:5 - NKJV</cite>

> I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men.
<cite>2 Sa 7:14 - NKJV</cite>

> He who withholds his rod hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines him diligently.
<cite>Pr 13:24 - NASV</cite>

> Chasten your son while there is hope, And do not set your heart on his destruction*.
<cite>Pr 19:18 - NKJV </cite>

> Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of correction will drive it far from him.
<cite>Pr 22:15 - NKJV</cite>

> Do not withhold correction from a child, For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die.  14 You shall beat him with a rod, And deliver his soul from hell.
<cite>Pr 23:13 - NKJV</cite>

> Don't fail to correct your children. They won't die if you spank them. Physical discipline may well save them from death.
<cite>Pr 23:13-14 - NLT</cite>

> The rod and reproof give wisdom, But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother.
<cite>Pr 29:15 - NASV</cite>

> To discipline and reprimand a child produces wisdom, but a mother is disgraced by an undisciplined child.
<cite>Pr 29:15 - NLT</cite>


> What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?
<cite>1 Co 4:21 - NASV</cite>

Read Hebrews 12:4-11 in your Bible.  Study it.  See how it applies to you and how you can apply it to your children. Don’t skip this! 

> As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent.
<cite>Rv 3:19 - NKJV</cite>

What a loving God we have that He should consider us and treat us as His Children!
Parents who love their children will chastise, yes, spank, their children.  Do not fear losing your child’s love (or being politically correct!) more than obeying God’s will.  God will use this to do a work in your children for their good; our obedience does matter greatly.

Do not be a parent like Eli who was warned in I Sam 2: 22-35, who lost all that he had because of his parenting priorities.  Even King David made terrible parenting mistakes.  Regarding his son Adonijah, I Kings 1:6 says, “ His father had never crossed (interfered, disciplined, rebuked) him at any time…”  Adonijah tried to take the throne near David’s death.  One of David’s other sons raped his half-sister, was murdered by his half-brother who eventually briefly took the throne from David himself.

### Specifics on spanking

**How to administer chastisement**: There are several components to biblical chastisement which are beneficial and help with “checks and balances” to avoid harm.  (Truly, these apply to all type of discipline/chastisement.)  When a child first has committed a sin that you decide requires chastisement (i.e. rebellion, disrespect, etc.):
1.	The child must then and there be made aware that he has broken the rules, and understand that punishment follows.  If too much time passes, many children, especially small ones, may have no clue what they have done wrong.  Keep it fresh in the mind.
2.	They must be moved to where they can be punished without embarrassment or public ridicule for either the parent or the child, typically their room. You can send them there and follow after a few minutes, allowing them to think over their wrong and you to calm down enough to administer the chastisement without anger (or smiles!). You can also use that few minutes to think through why their behavior was wrong and how you will relate it to God's standards.
3.	You should ask them what they did wrong (or explain it to them if they are quite young) and why they knew that this was wrong. You can also either explain that they are going to be spanked for their actions/behavior or ask them what happens when they do that behavior. Be sure that they know that their behavior is what began the whole reaction of punishment. They are responsible. (Use the word "you" often if needed.) Explain why it is wrong in God's eyes/the Bible. They need to realize their sin is not just against you but also against God.
4.Have the child bend over your lap, bend over the bed or lean over and hold their ankles. Administer the spanking using swat(s) with instrument (see below).
5. With younger children, pick them up on your lap for the restoration time; older children you may want to let them be alone to quit crying, regain their composure, and consider repentance. This again allows time for the parent to consider teaching.
6. When the child is calm, go back to teach and restore the child.  This involves reminding of the offense, why it was foolish, teaching ways to avoid future similar behaviors, and a reminder that we discipline and even spank because we love them!   (This will be covered more in the future.)  Take them back to the Holiness, Truth, Love of God (etc.) so that they see we operate on the perfect standard.  We act this way because God acts this way.  This is extremely important! You can also explain that you, too, break God's rules and receive chastisement. It's a wonderful time to explain how Jesus received punishment FOR us.
7. Pray with the child. You may need to guide them in what to say, how to ask God for forgiveness, etc. while they are young.
8. The child should then say words that they have been taught (by you): “I’m sorry that I [disobeyed you].  Will you forgive me?”  They need to be taught this before this time and learn to say it without difficulty remembering. Of course, remind them, if needed. If you sense that they are not ready to say this, leave the room again and let them think about it some more.  Sometimes it takes 2-3 more “isolation breaks” for them to realize that they need to repent.  
9. When they do verbalize repentance, we recommend immediate restoration and a big hug.  Remind them again that you love them.  You generally need not bring this up again—it is over. Do NOT bring this up again—they are forgiven at this point as God forgives us—forever.

**Instrumentation**: A biblical rod came from a tree branch or bush stem.  Ezzo believes that things unbending should not be used as they may break fingers that get in the way or cause serious damage.  Our reply is that if you might break fingers, you are not in control of your anger or your arm!  Most any instrument may be used so long as it is used thoughtfully—meaning the force used should match the instrument.  We normally used a very firm object but did not strike with reckless abandon.  (We broke several wooden spoons but never fingers.)  A belt, on the other hand, can more easily exceed the intended force used and cause real harm or injury.  In short, take care with whatever you use.

We chose not to use our hands whenever possible because we always wanted our hands to show love, not pain; we never wanted our children to fear the touch of our hand.  Once in a while we were forced to use the hand, but we do not recommend it as general practice.

**Force**:  This will vary with the age of the child, the instrument used, and the offense.  Generally, younger children only need one good swat while older may need several.  A harder, larger instrument requires less force for pain, and a more serious offense should be more memorable.  Match rebellious attitude with greater “adjustment”.  If it does not cause significant pain, it is not accomplishing the purpose for which it is intended, and it will not only not help, it may possibly be worse than doing nothing. It is like no discipline.

**Application**: Spankings should normally be on the buttock covered by modest clothing. Sometimes the upper thigh is better or as good. Small children will usually respond well to smaller infractions by a slap on the hand.  Again, this should hurt and cause crying.  Never strike the child anywhere on the face or head; this causes ridicule and humiliation which is never the goal of biblical parenting.  Godly, biblical chastisement will not break the spirit of the child (it hopefully will break his rebellious will), but a lack of love and humiliation will break the spirit and potentially cause deep harm.  God does not ridicule us; we must not ridicule our children.

We think it’s wise to have the child bend over and grab their calves, not letting go until spanking is finished.  If they put their hands back there, they will get hit and a normal spanking still follows.

Occasionally with small children out in public, something must be done at the time, and spanking is not an option.  We often would place our hand on their inner thigh and tell them what was to happen—either a pinch for foolishness or a warning to regain their composure or a pinch would follow.  Older children may need reminding of the rules and that they will receive their consequences for their behavior when they get home again.  On rare occasion, completely ignoring tantrums or other behaviors may be the best public option—with other consequences to follow later.  Only ignore bad behavior if you cannot deal with it immediately and intend to deal with it definitively later.

Children who are spanked more often early in life typically require much less spanking—and chastisement—overall.  They learn early on to control their actions and behavior, so discipline later is much smoother.  Spankings will become less over time and should be almost gone before age 10, most by age 5-6.

### Some Considerations:
* PAIN: Pain is something that none of us enjoy, but it is a gift from God--yes, a gift. The lack of physical pain causes some pretty severe pathology. For example, when pain is not present from diabetic neuropathy, infection is able to run rampant without early detection, leading to amputations--or worse. Without pain from our bad behaviors, we may be led to believe that nothing is wrong with the action that we just performed. What do you do when you encounter pain? Pain warns us that something is not right, and it teaches us to stop doing whatever we are doing! Pain helps a child gain focus and self-control over destructive behavior.
* Life is full of pain--it is unavoidable. It is not so important to always avoid pain but, instead, teach your child how to handle pain and control his reaction.
* We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment. Jim Rohn
### Why chastisement sometimes fails to work.
* Parents are inconsistent in application; it brings about a feeling of gambling or frustration.  Better to not spank at all.  This is your toughest problem as it takes time and effort.
* It is not painful enough—perhaps using the wrong instrument, too thick clothing, not enough force or number of swats, parent not convinced that this is truly the best punishment.
* Parents talk too much, making it too difficult for the child to remember and understand what he has done wrong or become bored with the whole process.
* Failing to establish clear boundaries and guidelines.
* Children feel like the only true attention they get is during the spanking process. (Ouch!)
* Far too much has been done by poor parenting techniques over time to rely heavily on chastisement.


### What is to be avoided:
* Physical harm; only physical pain should occur.
* Stay far away from any abusive behaviors: verbal aggression, verbal assaults, excessive & out-of-control physical punishment, uncontrolled emotions, and absence of reason—sin on your part!  If you are out of control, get away and seek help if necessary.  Never discipline when out of control; better to wait and deal with it later.

### Repentance & Relationship
A person can regret their actions but still not be repentant.  We see famous people everyday “regretting” their actions but not repenting—not admitting moral fault, turning away, and asking forgiveness.  Children will typically express regret and sorrow for their offense when they get caught.  We, and our children, need to be truly repentant and seek forgiveness when we sin against another person.

> Yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. 10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
<cite>2 Co 7:9 - NIV</cite>

Just as our relationship with God is harmed when we sin, our children’s relationship with us is hurt when they disobey.  When the child realizes that his actions have affected the relationship and repents, asking forgiveness, true repentance occurs.  This will repair the relationship.

When we look at Judges, we see a repetitive cycle where God’s people sin, are separated from God, repent, and are restored.  Life is very much like this, and our children will know that they need restoration.  In order for this to happen the child needs a contrite heart and asking forgiveness is necessary for the process to be complete.  A child may say, “I’m sorry” for a mistake, but restoration from sin and rebellion requires repentance and forgiveness. A child not allowed forgiveness may carry long-term guilt.

Restitution is repayment for lost, damaged, or stolen property.  Exodus 22 has several rules in this regard.  There are times when your child should make restitution for things they may have broken in order to restore a relationship.  Sometimes you will need to help with this.  Base your dealings on the situation at hand.

If your child confesses wrongdoing before being caught, praise him for honesty, but he still (likely) needs to be punished for the wrong.  Your punishment may be changed by his good actions.  Sometimes they will only confess when they know they are going to get caught anyway.  This does not mean much!

Make sure that your children see and experience you asking forgiveness, both from God for infractions against Him, and from them if you commit sin against them. This will make the whole restitution process much more meaningful and easier after chastisement.

### Foolishness
Willful, intentional defiance and open rebellion are what the Bible calls foolishness. (Pr 22:15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him. NIV)

Folly: deception, trickery, disobedience, lacking in wisdom, or rebellion. A fool is an adult whose parents have never trained the foolishness out of him. Our job is to help transform the heart from what it is naturally to what it should be biblically.
Disobeying, talking back, refusing to accept correction, and rejecting any form of authority are all expressions of direct, willful defiance. A haughty loook, pretending not to hear, pleading ignorance to the obvious after being caught in a misdeed, doing something "good" or "cute" to get out of doing what was instructed , and constantly saying, "I forgot", are various forms of a more passive, indirect defiance. So is sulking, pouting, and whining.

### Consider 4 factors when deciding how to correct a child's actions:
1. Nature of the offense (Is it rebellious? Is it disrespect for your authority? Is it lying? Is it childishness? Is it forgetfulness?)
2. Frequency of the offense
3. Context of the moment (is there some unusual reason they behaved that way? Excessively tired, hungry, etc.) This may not change their need for punishment, but it might change the decisions you make around the punishment and help you avoid it in the future.

## Three Hard & Fast rules: 

_These should never be broken._

1.	**Do not leave your correction to your spouse**.  Several things can potentially happen.  First, children will learn that the “non-correcting” parent is not to be truly respected—they do nothing without the “correcting” parent, and many times they will just let things slide either because it is easier or they forget.  They will begin to behave worse and worse with less respect towards this “lame” parent.  Second, they may begin to hate when—typically the Father—comes home because he comes home to punish children for things he has not witnessed or been part of.  This may cause distance in that relationship, and it will surely cause friction in the marriage.  It is sort of a “good-cop, bad-cop” parenting situation.  If need for punishment arises, deal with it then and there whenever possible.  Don’t wait and make someone else deal with it.
2.	**Never reveal parental conflict** over discipline issues in front of the child.  As we have said before, whenever possible, take the discussion over punishment/discipline issues somewhere else to clarify and agree so a united front is presented to the child.  This keeps the child from pitting one parent against another and also keeps them from possibly always blaming one parent for being too strict and the other too weak.  They will pick up on parental conflict very quickly and use this.
3.	You must **be consistent in responding** to bad—or good—behaviors.  Being inconsistent may truly frustrate your child (they do not know what to expect and are often surprised) or they may enjoy this and treat it as a type of gambling.  Some children will repeatedly be bad in order to test you, wear you out, and “win” the struggle.  They are gambling that you will not respond with discipline but instead become angry, tired, and not punish them.  This is very dangerous.

## Questions
1.	What is the purpose of a reward? What does it reinforce?
2.	How does childishness differ from foolishness?
3.	What’s the difference between punishment and correction?  Why must we make the distinction?
4.	How is pain beneficial?  What type of response does it bring about?
5.	What are the 2 disciplinary consequences of foolishness?
6.	What are the 3 types of structured disciplinary consequences?
7.	Name as many of the steps of chastisement as you can.
8.	What are some guidelines of the technique of spanking?
9.	Why can chastisement fail?
10.	What is the difference between regret and repentance?

## Homework
1.	Take time to encourage your child verbally and physically at the same time. How was it received?
2.	Use rewards appropriately. Tell us about it next week.
3.	Were you ever exasperated by a punishment when you were a child?
4.	Study and learn the steps of biblical chastisement.  Teach your children what to expect if they are old enough to understand and prepare to begin spanking.
5.	Find illustrations of people who confess regret but do not repent.
